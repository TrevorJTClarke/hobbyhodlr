#### Your Decentralized Finance Portfolio, Goals & Projections Tool
This is a hobby project built during [Hack Money Hackathon](https://ethglobal.online/)!
I built this because my wife wanted an easy way to view a crypto portfolio.

## Integrations Setup

HobbyHodlr uses several services to enable data for things like asset prices or asset availability. Set these keys in the Settings page.

The following accounts are optional for HobbyHodlr to work correctly:

* [Amberdata.io](https://amberdata.io/onboarding) - For retrieving blockchain assets, account balances
* [Portis Wallet](https://portis.io/) - For retrieving blockchain account addresses
* [Slack Webhook (Coming Soon)](https://slack.com/help/articles/115005265063-Incoming-Webhooks-for-Slack) & [Rocket.Chat (Coming Soon)](#) - For alerting prices, staking updates
* [Quandl API Key](https://www.quandl.com/search?filters=%5B%22Free%22%5D&query=gold) - For retrieving gold prices
* [Alphavantage API Key](https://www.alphavantage.co/) - For retrieving traditional stocks data

## Server Setup

This repo is built to be run on a local server or computer for local network monitoring. It uses mongo database, and keeps track of minimal information for things like price and account history. Setup uses the following commands:

```
$ npm i
$ npm run build
$ npm start
```

Once the server is running, navigate to your local IP, at port 2000. Example: http://localhost:2000

## Using Docker:
```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/TrevorJTClarke/hobby-hodlr.git
cd hobby-hodlr
cp secrets/.env.example secrets/.env
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd)/secrets:/home/node/app/secrets hobbyhodlr/portfolio:latest run init
docker-compose up
```
Run in detached mode (to suppress output):
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```


## Docker Setup

```bash
docker-compose up
```

If you make changes to the node app then run the following to rebuild the image
before launching containers:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
Note: The data for mongodb is stored in the `/data` folder.

### Inspecting the app
```bash
docker run --rm -it --entrypoint=/bin/bash hobbyhodlr/portfolio
```

### Inspecting the mongo database
If you want to inspect the mongo database and gain access to the [mongo shell](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/mongo/), you
may do so with the following commands:
```bash
docker exec -it mongo /bin/bash
mongo "mongodb://$MONGO_USERNAME:$MONGO_PASSWORD@$MONGO_HOSTNAME/$MONGO_DATABASE?retryWrites=true&w=majority&authSource=admin"
```

The first command will launch a bash shell within the docker container running the
mongodb instance using docker's [exec command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/exec/).
Then we use the mongo command, and the database url to connect
and launch the mongo shell.

### Join the HobbyHodlr DAO!

Want to request new features, fund ongoing development or just shill HODL tokens? Request to join the [HobbyHodlr DAO](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/hobbyhodlrs/0xfca15a0cfc64a01cec6de3dbcfbd01a1b663235f/) hosted on aragon.

#### Why a DAO?

A DAO is needed to fully decentralize ownership and governance of the HobbyHodlr project. The goal is to create a community driving the continued development of this project. Then with more support, each portfolio within local HobbyHodlr instances could launch a DAO which could effectively run like a decentralized hedge fund! Game ON.
